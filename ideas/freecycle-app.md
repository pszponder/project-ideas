# Freecycle-like App

## Project Name(s)

- Free Junk
- Bestow Treasure

## Idea(s)

- App which would enable people to post items for free
- Mobile-friendly frontend
- No user account, just create a post and add your email
- Email is used to send a link to the poster which can be used to update the post
- Enable user to specify validity of post before it gets erased (up to a maximum)
- User can renew the post using the link up to certain limit, then they would have to create a new post
- Inspiration / similar apps
  - Craigslist
  - Freecycle
  - Facebook Marketplace
  - Nextdoor
  - OfferUp
  - Letgo
- Consider security concerns? Is it a security risk if users post their address for people to come and pick up stuff (either for the poster or the person picking up the items)?
