# Kanban Board

## Project Name(s)

## Ideas

- Build a kanban board (ex. trello) fullstack application
- How will you be able to implement system where multiple users can interact with the board and view other's updates?
- Will need a way to containerize and host backend so that client applications can connect to the backend
- Focus on implementing self-hosted solution?
