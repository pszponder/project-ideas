# Game(s) Ideas

## Ideas

- Create a game (Legend of Zelda / D&D inspired?) which uses AI to dynamically create an adventure
  - The AI is kind of like the dungeon master
  - Make this CLI-based choose-your-own-adventure type game first
  - Maybe add a front end with some UI
  - What if the AI generates a maze or something for the player to navigate through?
